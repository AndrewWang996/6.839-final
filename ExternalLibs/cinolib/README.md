## Usage
CinoLib is header only. It does not need to be installed, all you have to do is to clone the repo with
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/maxicino/cinolib.git
```
and include in your C++ application the header files you need. A tutorial with detailed info on how to use the library is under developement. In the meanwhile, you can explore the [**/examples**](https://github.com/maxicino/cinolib/tree/master/examples)  folder, which contains a constantly growing number of sample projects that showcase the core features of the library, and will be the backbone of the forthcoming tutorial.
