## Autotools
The preferred method to test and install CppAD uses cmake.
The deprecated autotools procedure can be used for this purpose,
but it will eventually be removed.
For any sub-directory *dir*,
files of the form *dir*/`makefile.am` and *dir*/`makefile.in`
are used to support the autotools test and install procedure.
In addition,
the following files, in this directory, are also for this purpose:
`compile`,
`config.guess`,
`config.sub`,
`configure.ac`,
`depcomp`,
`install-sh`,
`missing`.


## Tarballs
CppAD is available from Coin-OR with both the EPL and GPL licenses; see
the versions link above. There is a separate tarball on the
Coin-OR download page
for each version and each license.

## Documentation
The web documentaition (linked above) is for the most recent version of CppAD.
The tarballs mentioned above include documention for the corresponding version
in a `doc` subdirectory.
