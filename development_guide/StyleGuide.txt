Rules:
-Make as many methods const.  If a method needs things that aren't const, see if you can modularize out all the things that are const.
-Make as many variables const.
-Use uints where appropriate (counters)
-Write tests for every method to make sure the method itself is going to be fast!!!  Simple, short functions that have a little latency and then get called a lot = bad!  Let's try to keep this blazingly fast.
-Try to optimize all your code as you go (controversial statement, I know).  In other words, as soon as you get something new going, try to make it as fast as possible.
-Pass everything you can by reference, for memory allocation reasons.
-Use fixed-size vectors whenever possible.
-Pre-allocate memory whenever possible.  Memory allocation is the root of all slowdowns.
-Avoid raw pointers whenever possible.  In fact, avoid pointers altogether except when needed.
